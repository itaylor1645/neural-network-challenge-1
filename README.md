# Student Loan Credit Ranking Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to import a CSV file containing information on student loans and predict the `credit_ranking` (approved or not) using a sequential neural network model.

In this notebook, we will:

1. Import a CSV file containing student loan data.
2. Preprocess the data for modeling.
3. Build a sequential neural network model.
4. Train the model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not (`credit_ranking`).
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
